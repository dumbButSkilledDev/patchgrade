# patchgrade
Nintendo switch patched erista research for 8.01+<br>
Thats also EXTREAMLY DANGROUS.<br>
(this is called a research on getting tegra x1 rcm to load a older signed image, and somehow flashing it)<br>
Yet, if we manage to get it working, it will be very dangrous. You will need to run the exploit AS soon as possible to enable autorcm, and not reboot, cuz if you do, your cooked.<br>
Asuming that the switch wont reboot after updating, it would jump to horizon, witch we have downgraded, somehow... (the bootloader downgrade will be easy, the horizonOS downgrade will be extreamly hard to figure out.
# what the actually f-... i mean, what is this?
Research of downgrading rcm patched eristras and other non rcm exploitable devices to exploitable versions.
# ETA WEN!!!
This is not a utility<br>
I may develop a downgrade utility, if this research comes out successful.
# TODO
- manualy load boot0, via a bct
